# Creditcardfrauddetection
This Project works on credit card fraud detection using various machine learning libraries
The most frequent issue in the modern world is the identification of credit card fraud. This is a result of the expansion of e-commerce platforms and online transactions. In most cases, credit card fraud occurs when the card is stolen and used for any unauthorised activity, or even when the fraudster utilises the card's information for his own gain. We have a lot of credit card issues in the modern world. The credit card fraud detection technology was created to identify fraudulent actions. The primary emphasis of this research will be machine learning methods. 
# Machine Learning Techniques used
1) Supervised Learning: 
a) Logistic Regression: A common approach for modelling the connection between input factors and a binary output is logistic regression. By identifying patterns in data that has been expressly labelled with fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, it may be used to detect credit card fraud.
b) Decision Trees: Decision trees use a sequence of if-then criteria to split the data into groups that resemble trees. They are comprehensible and can represent intricate decision-making processes. Additionally, numerous decision trees are combined using ensemble approaches like Random Forests.
2) Unsupervised Learning: 
a) K-means clustering: K-means Using distance measurements, the clustering algorithm K-means assembles related data points. By combining those with similar features, it may spot groups of fraudulent transactions. 
b) DBSCAN: Data points are grouped according to their density in DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), a density-based clustering technique. By treating outliers as noise, it can identify areas where fraudulent transactions are prevalent.
   # Necessity of Credit Card Fraud Detection System.
   A credit card fraud detection system is required due to the serious dangers and repercussions linked to credit card theft. Here are a few arguments supporting the significance of such systems: 
1) Preventing Financial Losses: Both consumers and financial institutions suffer significant financial losses as a result of credit card theft. Fraudulent transactions can result in disputed payments, stolen money, and unauthorised charges, which directly costs cardholders money. Credit card fraud can cause financial liabilities, reimbursement responsibilities, and reputational harm for financial organisations. In order to reduce these financial losses and safeguard the interests of both individuals and organisations, a strong fraud detection system must be put in place. 
2) Customer Trust and Confidence: The use of fraudulent credit cards damages consumers' faith in the payment system. People's confidence in the security and dependability of financial services is damaged when they encounter fraudulent activity on their credit cards. Financial institutions may show their dedication to consumer safety, establish trust, and sustain long-term relationships with their clients by putting in place efficient fraud detection systems. 
3) Early Detection and Mitigation: Fraud detection systems make it possible to identify 
suspect or fraudulent activity before it is too late. These systems can identify trends, 
abnormalities, and behavioural aberrations linked to fraudulent transactions by utilising 
sophisticated analytics and machine learning approaches. Early detection enables 
financial institutions to limit possible losses and stop more fraudulent acts by acting 
quickly to restrict transactions, alert consumers, and launch investigations. 
4) Adaptive Protection Against Changing Fraud Techniques: The tactics used to 
commit credit card fraud are always changing as criminals come up with new ways to 
get around established security measures. In order to adapt to and learn from new fraud 
patterns and strategies, a comprehensive fraud detection system makes use of cutting
edge technology, such as machine learning. Due to its versatility, the system is 
guaranteed to continue identifying new fraud strategies and provide proactive defence 
against advancing threats. 
5) Protection of Reputation and Brand: Incidents involving credit card fraud can 
seriously harm a financial institution's reputation and brand image. The confidence of 
current and future clients might be eroded by news of security breaches and fraudulent 
actions. By putting in place a reliable fraud detection system, financial institutions can 
show their dedication to protecting their customers while preserving their reputation 
and brand image.
